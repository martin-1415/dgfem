\section{Conclusion}

Novel limiting criterion for limiting process within discontinuous Galerkin method was introduced. This criterion works for both water depth and discharge variables. In Section \ref{DBwet} and \ref{psp}, there was proven that this novel numerical scheme brings better accuracy than finite volume method and DGFEM with global limiting. In the paper there is also successfully implemented the wet/dry treatment which prevents the scheme from spurious negative water depth and preserve conservativity of the scheme. Adopted velocity modification (\ref{formVel}) avoids appearance of the non-physically large velocities caused by numerical inaccuracy.


It is concluded that the presented scheme is able to solve the flow over complex topography and keep the C-property in the flooded domain. The scheme also give good results for both wetting and drying processes.

 The future work can be focused on the bed friction source term and its stability around wet/dry interface when the water depth is approaching zero values and wet/dry interface treatment for the bed function described by higher order polynomials.
