abstract = "In this paper, a second order space discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is presented for the numerical solution of inviscid shallow water flows over varying bottom topography. Novel in the implementation is the use of \{HLLC\} and kinetic numerical fluxes1HLLC stands for the Harten, Lax, and Van Leer or \{HLL\} flux extended to deal with Contact waves, whence the abbreviation HLLC. 1 in combination with a dissipation operator, applied only locally around discontinuities to limit spurious numerical oscillations. Numerical solutions over (non-)uniform meshes are verified against exact solutions; the numerical error in the L2-norm and the convergence of the solution are computed. Bore–vortex interactions are studied analytically and numerically to validate the model; these include bores as “breaking waves” in a channel and a bore traveling over a conical and Gaussian hump. In these complex numerical test cases, we correctly predict the generation of potential vorticity by non-uniform bores. Finally, we successfully validate the numerical model against measurements of steady oblique hydraulic jumps in a channel with a contraction. In the latter case, the kinetic flux is shown to be more robust. "

abstract="Free boundaries in shallow-water equations demarcate the time-dependent water line between ``flooded'' and ``dry'' regions. We present a novel numerical algorithm to treat flooding and drying in a formally second-order explicit space discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretization of the one-dimensional or symmetric shallow-water equations. The algorithm uses fixed Eulerian flooded elements and a mixed Eulerian--Lagrangian element at each free boundary. When the time step is suitably restricted, we show that the mean water depth is positive. This time-step restriction is based on an analysis of the discretized continuity equation while using the HLLC flux. The algorithm and its implementation are tested in comparison with a large and relevant suite of known exact solutions. The essence of the flooding and drying algorithm pivots around the analysis of a continuity equation with a fluid velocity and a pseudodensity (in the shallow water case the depth). It therefore also applies, for example, to space discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretizations of the compressible Euler equations in which vacuum regions emerge, in analogy of the above dry regions. We believe that the approach presented can be extended to finite-volume discretizations with similar mean level and slope reconstruction.",

volume="74",
number="11",
pages="7285--7294",
abstract="Urban flooding may lead to significant losses of properties and lives and numerical modelling can facilitate better flood risk management to reduce losses. Flood modelling generally involves seeking numerical solutions to the shallow water equations (SWEs) or one of the simplified forms using the traditional numerical methods including the finite difference method (FDM), finite volume method (FVM) and finite element method (FEM). Recently, a relatively new approach, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), has also been used to solve the SWEs and encouraging results have been reported. However, the SPH method is computationally too demanding for efficient simulations, which has been one of the major disadvantages dogging its wider applications. This work presents an SPH model that is computationally accelerated by modern graphic processing units (GPUs) for efficient urban flooding modelling. The model's predictive capability and enhanced computational efficiency are demonstrated by application to experimental and field-scale hypothetic urban flood events.",

abstract = {Although considerable progress has been made in the application of two- and three-dimensional shallow water models to simulate flow in estuaries and coastal lagoons, a number of outstanding problems still remain in this branch of computational fluid dynamics. These problems mainly deal with the proper representation of physical processes and arise when dealing with very shallow flow, temporary submergence and time-dependent flow domains, and complex morphology, and are often related to inaccuracies in modeling the geometry of the domain. Among others, wetting and drying of salt marshes and tidal flats, inclusion of the small scale drainage networks which often strongly affect hydrodynamics, turbulence closure schemes, and accurate friction evaluation are discussed in this paper. To better illustrate these problems and their possible solutions some examples are presented which use the Venice lagoon as a benchmark shallow tidal basin characterized by a complex interplay of channels and marshes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Spinewine2011,
abstract = {The 4 × 4 system of governing equations for two-layer shallow flow models is known to exhibit particular behaviours such as loss of hyperbolicity under certain flow configurations. An eigenvalue analysis of the conservation part of the equations shows that the loss of hyperbolicity is due only to the reaction exerted by each fluid onto the other at the interface between the fluids. Three Riemann solvers derived from the HLL formalism are presented. In the first solver, the pressure-induced terms are accounted for by the source term; in the second solver, they are incorporated into the fluxes; the third solver uses the same formulation as the first, except that the mass and momentum balance for the bottom layer are replaced with the balance equations for the system formed by the two layers as a whole. Numerical results using the three solvers are presented for (1) static conditions such as two fluids of identical densities at rest above each other, (2) dam-break flows involving the collapse of a body of light fluid over a uniform layer of a denser fluid, and (3) Liska and Wendroff's ill-posed test cases [24] involving two-layer flows over a topographic bump. The three solvers produce quasi-undistinguishable results for the dam-break flows, and produce sharp solutions over the full range of density ratio, from 0 to 1. However, only the third solver allows a strict preservation of static configurations. Moreover, a method is proposed to assess the convergence of the numerical solutions in the configurations for which no analytical solution can be obtained. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Ata2013,
abstract = {This work focuses on the application of a Weighted Average Flux (WAF) approximation to the shallow water equations with friction and real bathymetry on unstructured two dimensional grids. The scheme obtained must satisfy severe numerical criteria so it can be implemented in the TELEMAC code, widely used in industry.Despite its interesting numerical properties (at least in theory, which includes second order in time and space), WAF approximation is rarely applied to unstructured meshes. Here, we provide a general method for applying the WAF scheme to a homogenous equation. The general and efficient discretization of the topographic source term (through hydrostatic reconstruction) and friction (with a semi-implicit way) is also presented. We applied the approximation using the HLLC Riemann solver within a vertex-centered finite volume framework. The discretization obtained is validated with several theoretical and real benchmarks. The WAF-HLLC scheme proposed is also compared to several other well-known schemes such as HLLC, Roe and Kinetic type schemes. The results obtained show that the behavior of the scheme is encouraging as they demonstrate well-balanceness, strict mass conservation, positivity of water depth, efficient treatment of wetting and drying phenomena, good shock-capturing and low numerical diffusion. Nevertheless, the second order of accuracy in space is not attained with sufficient rigor and remains an open problem requiring more detailed study. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The shallow-water equations are used to model the flow resulting from the sudden release of a finite volume of frictionless, incompressible fluid down a uniform slope of arbitrary inclination. The hodograph transformation and Riemann’s method make it possible to transform the governing equations into a linear system and then deduce an exact analytical solution expressed in terms of readily evaluated integrals. Although the solution treats an idealized case never strictly realized in nature, it is uniquely well-suited for testing the robustness and accuracy of numerical models used to model shallow-water flows on steep slopes.},

Flow conditions and spreading of tracer in the main stream are simulated for mean discharge and a moderate flooding event using the Hydroinformatics Modelling System (HMS). It was found out that the bottom roughness has a considerable influence on velocities, especially in S\~{a}o Francisco river. In both cases, water flows from the river into the bay with very small velocities. Tese velocities increase significantly during flood event but still remain small in comparison with the velocities in the main stream. In the cases investigated yet, a tracer injected at the upstream boundary does not enter the bay and is transported downstream. In both cases, the tracer spreads mainly in flow direction while diffusion perpendicular to the flow direction is small.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {A well-balanced Godunov-type finite volume algorithm is developed for modelling free-surface shallow flows over irregular topography with complex geometry. The algorithm is based on a new formulation of the classical shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Unstructured triangular grids are used to achieve the adaptability of the grid to the geometry of the problem and to facilitate localised refinement. The numerical fluxes are calculated using HLLC approximate Riemann solver, and the MUSCL-Hancock predictor-corrector scheme is adopted to achieve the second-order accuracy both in space and in time where the solutions are continuous, and to achieve high-resolution results where the solutions are discontinuous. The novelties of the algorithm include preserving well-balanced property without any additional correction terms and the wet/dry front treatments. The good performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparing numerical and theoretical results of several benchmark problems, including the preservation of still water over a two-dimensional hump, the idealised dam-break flow over a frictionless flat rectangular channel, the circular dam-break, and the shock wave from oblique wall. Besides, two laboratory dam-break cases are used for model validation. Furthermore, a practical application related to dam-break flood wave propagation over highly irregular topography with complex geometry is presented. The results show that the algorithm can correctly account for free-surface shallow flows with respect to its effectiveness and robustness thus has bright application prospects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A well-balanced shallow water flow model on quadtree cut cell grids is presented. The Cartesian cut cell method is applied due to its flexibility in treating curvilinear boundaries. In order to preserve a lake-at-rest and the positivity of water depths in drying/wetting zones, the hydrostatic reconstruction proposed by Audusse et al. [1] is implemented on cut cell grids. In addition, the gradient construction method on cut cells proposed by Causon et al. [8] is modified due to the spurious calculation when a solid boundary is nearly parallel to grids. The numerical schemes mentioned above are employed in Gerris which is open source free software and provides a shallow water solver on adaptive quadtree grids. The applied numerical schemes are validated using four test simulations: still water in an inclined domain; oscillation in a parabolic container; shock reflection by a circular cylinder; flash flood experiment in a model city. The simulation results are compared with analytical solutions, experiment data and the results simulated by other researchers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Details are given of a numerical model for predicting solute transport in shallow waters. The alternating operator-splitting technique is used to separate the spatial discretisation of the advection and diffusion terms in each step of the time marching procedure. In the diffusion stage, a second-order accurate central scheme is used. In the advection stage, a five-point Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) modification is made to the standard MacCormack scheme. The model performance is examined by comparing numerical predictions with analytical solutions and some other numerical model results for idealised test cases. The model is also used to simulate the motion of a contaminant cloud in the River Thames estuary, where extensive wetting and drying occurs with the tidal oscillation. The present model displays sufficiently high efficiency and accuracy in solving the solute transport problems in a natural aquatic environment. It is free of fictitious oscillations close to sharp concentration gradients, while retaining second-order accuracy in smooth regions. Attention has also been paid to ensure the accurate treatment of the cross-diffusion terms and mass balance in complex flow situations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents the analytical properties of the solutions of the sensitivity equations for steady-state, two-dimensional shallow water flow. These analytical properties are used to provide guidelines for model calibration and validation. The sensitivity of the water depth/level and that of the longitudinal unit discharge are shown to contain redundant information. Under subcritical conditions, the sensitivities of the flow variables are shown to obey an anisotropic elliptic equation. The main directions of the contour lines for water depth and the longitudinal unit discharge sensitivity are parallel and perpendicular to the flow, while they are diagonal to the flow for the transverse unit discharge sensitivity. Moreover, the sensitivity for all three variables extends farther in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction, the anisotropy ratio being a function of the sole Froude number. For supercritical flow, the sensitivity obeys an anisotropic hyperbolic equation. These findings are confirmed by application examples on idealized and real-world simulations. The sensitivities to the geometry, friction coefficient or model boundary conditions are shown to behave in different ways, thus providing different types of information for model calibration and validation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Anal., 36 (2002), pp. 397–425]. Depending on the reconstruction step, the second-order versions of the schemes there could be made either well-balanced or positivity preserving, but fail to satisfy both properties simultaneously. Here, we introduce an improved second-order central-upwind scheme which, unlike its forerun- ners, is capable to both preserve stationary steady states (lake at rest) and to guarantee the positivity of the computed fluid depth. Another novel property of the proposed scheme is its applicability to models with discontinuous bottom topography. We demonstrate these features of the new scheme, as well as its high resolution and robustness in a number of one- and two-dimensional examples.},

@article{VonHippel2005,
abstract = {Many textbooks teach a rule of thumb stating that the mean is right of the median under right skew, and left of the median under left skew. This rule fails with surprising frequency. It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median. We discuss ways to correct ideas about mean, median, and skew, while enhancing the desired intuition.},

abstract = {Abstract Planners concerned with water resource protection in urbanizing areas must deal with the adverse impacts of polluted runoff. Impervious surface coverage is a quantifiable land-use indicator that correlates closely with these impacts. Once the role and distribution of impervious coverage are understood, a wide range of strategies to reduce impervious surfaces and their impacts on water resources can be applied to community planning, site-level planning and design, and land use regulation. These strategies complement many current trends in planning, zoning, and landscape design that go beyond water pollution concerns to address the quality of life in a community.},

@article{Guinot2007,
abstract = {The present paper focuses on the governing equations for the sensitivity of the variables to the parameters in flow models that can be described by one-dimensional scalar, hyperbolic conservation laws. The sensitivity is shown to obey a hyperbolic, scalar conservation law. The sensitivity is a conserved scalar except in the case of discontinuous flow solutions, where an extra, point source term must be added to the equations in order to enforce conservation. The propagation speed of the sensitivity waves being identical to that of the conserved variable in the original conservation law, the system of conservation laws formed by the original hyperbolic equation and the equation satisfied by the sensitivity is linearly degenerate. A consequence on the solution of the Riemann problem is that rarefaction waves for the variable of the original equation result in vacuum regions for the sensitivity. The numerical solution of the hyperbolic conservation law for the sensitivity by finite volume methods requires the implementation of a specific shock detection procedure. A set of necessary conditions is defined for the discretisation of the source term in the sensitivity equation. An application to the one-dimensional kinematic wave equation shows that the proposed numerical technique allows analytical solutions to be reproduced correctly. The computational examples show that first-order numerical schemes do not yield satisfactory numerical solutions in the neighbourhood of moving shocks and that higher-order schemes, such as the MUSCL scheme, should be used for sharp transients. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many researchers have reported failures of the approximate Riemann solvers in the presence of strong shock. This is believed to be due to perturbation transfer in the transverse direction of shock waves. We propose a simple and clear method to prevent such problems for the Harten-Lax-van Leer contact (HLLC) scheme. By defining a sensing function in the transverse direction of strong shock, the HLLC flux is switched to the Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) flux in that direction locally, and the magnitude of the additional dissipation is automatically determined using the HLL scheme. We combine the HLLC and HLL schemes in a single framework using a switching function. High-order accuracy is achieved using a weighted average flux (WAF) scheme, and a method for v-shear treatment is presented. The modified HLLC scheme is named HLLC-HLL. It is tested against a steady normal shock instability problem and Quirk's test problems, and spurious solutions in the strong shock regions are successfully controlled. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Tezduyar2008,
abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to MUSCL reconstruction for solving the shallow-water equations on two-dimensional unstructured meshes. The approach takes advantage of the particular structure of the shallow-water equations. Indeed, their hyperbolic nature allows the flow variables to be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of the system. The particularity of the shallow-water equations is that the coefficients of this combination only depend upon the water depth. Reconstructing only the water depth with second-order accuracy and using only a first-order reconstruction for the flow velocity proves to be as accurate as the classical MUSCL approach. The method also appears to be more robust in cases with very strong depth gradients such as the propagation of a wave on a dry bed. Since only one reconstruction is needed (against three reconstructions in the MUSCL approach) the EVR method is shown to be 1.4-5 times as fast as the classical MUSCL scheme, depending on the computational application.

Data obtained from a French highway both before and after the replacement of a conventional asphalt by a porous asphalt are compared. Statistical tests have been used to evaluate the significance of the differences detected. Firstly, the differences in hydrological behaviour between the two types of pavement is highlighted (retardant effect on the evacuation of water into the outlet, peak flow attenuation, mitigation of splashing by the pervious pavement). Secondly, the impact on water quality is investigated. The retention of particulate pollution by the porous pavement, which acts as a filter, is clearly demonstrated. This study also shows the probable impact of the type of pavement on the pollutant content in a dissolved form. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Modeling of flooding events resulting from bank overflooding and levee breaching is of relevant social and environmental interest. Two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic models integrating the shallow water equations turn out to be very effective tools for the purpose at hand. Many of the available models also use 1D channel elements, fully coupled to the 2D model, to simulate the flow of small channels dissecting the urban and rural areas, and 1D elements, referred to as 1D-links, to efficiently model the flow over levees, road and rail embankments, bunds, the flow through control gates, either free or submerged, and the operation of other hydraulic structures. In this work we propose a physically-based 1D-link to model breach formation and evolution in fluvial levees, and levee failure due to either piping or overtopping. The proposed 1D-link is then embedded in a 1D-2D hydrodynamic model, thus accounting for critical feedbacks between breach formation and changes in the hydrodynamic flow field. The breach model also includes the possibility of simulating breach closure, an important feature particularly in the view of hydraulic risk assessment and management of the emergency. The model is applied to five different case studies and the results of the numerical simulations compare favorably with field observations displaying a good agreement in terms of urban and rural flooded areas, water levels within the channel, final breach widths, and water volumes flowed through the breach. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrological simulation of rain-runoff processes is often performed with lumped models which rely on calibration to generate storm hydrographs and study catchment response to rain. In this paper, a distributed, physically-based numerical model is used for runoff simulation in a mountain catchment. This approach offers two advantages. The first is that by using shallow-water equations for runoff flow, there is less freedom to calibrate routing parameters (as compared to, for example, synthetic hydrograph methods). The second, is that spatial distributions of water depth and velocity can be obtained. Furthermore, interactions among the various hydrological processes can be modeled in a physically-based approach which may depend on transient and spatially distributed factors. On the other hand, the undertaken numerical approach relies on accurate terrain representation and mesh selection, which also affects significantly the computational cost of the simulations. Hence, we investigate the response of a gauged catchment with this distributed approach. The methodology consists of analyzing the effects that the mesh has on the simulations by using a range of meshes. Next, friction is applied to the model and the response to variations and interaction with the mesh is studied. Finally, a first approach with the well-known SCS Curve Number method is studied to evaluate its behavior when coupled with a shallow-water model for runoff flow. The results show that mesh selection is of great importance, since it may affect the results in a magnitude as large as physical factors, such as friction. Furthermore, results proved to be less sensitive to roughness spatial distribution than to mesh properties. Finally, the results indicate that SCS-CN may not be suitable for simulating hydrological processes together with a shallow-water model. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median. We discuss ways to correct ideas about mean, median, and skew, while enhancing the desired intuition.},

Results obtained using conventional and deviatoric forms of the conservative non-linear shallow water equations (SWEs) are compared for cases where the bed has a varying topography. The comparisons demonstrate that the deviatoric form of the SWEs gives more accurate results than the conventional form, in the absence of numerical balancing of the flux-gradient and source terms. A further comparison is undertaken between the TVD-MacCormack model and an alternating direction implicit (ADI) model for cases involving steep-fronted shallow flows. It is demonstrated that the ADI model is unable to predict trans-critical flows correctly, and artificial viscosity has to be introduced to remove spurious oscillations. The TVD-MacCormack model reproduces all flow regimes accurately. Finally, the TVD-MacCormack model is used to predict a laboratory-scale dyke break undertaken at Delft University of Technology. The predictions agree closely with the experimental data, and are in excellent agreement with results from an alternative Godunov-type model. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a genuinely two-dimensional HLLC Riemann solver. On logically rectangular meshes, it accepts four input states that come together at an edge and outputs the multi-dimensionally upwinded fluxes in both directions. This work builds on, and improves, our prior work on two-dimensional HLL Riemann solvers. The HLL Riemann solver presented here achieves its stabilization by introducing a constant state in the region of strong interaction, where four one-dimensional Riemann problems interact vigorously with one another. A robust version of the HLL Riemann solver is presented here along with a strategy for introducing sub-structure in the strongly-interacting state. Introducing sub-structure turns the two-dimensional HLL Riemann solver into a two-dimensional HLLC Riemann solver. The sub-structure that we introduce represents a contact discontinuity which can be oriented in any direction relative to the mesh.Video 1The Riemann solver presented here is general and can work with any system of conservation laws. We also present a second order accurate Godunov scheme that works in three dimensions and is entirely based on the present multidimensional HLLC Riemann solver technology. The methods presented are cost-competitive with traditional higher order Godunov schemes.The two-dimensional HLLC Riemann solver is shown to work robustly for Euler and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Several stringent test problems are presented to show that the inclusion of genuinely multidimensional effects into higher order Godunov schemes indeed produces some very compelling advantages. For two dimensional problems, we were routinely able to run simulations with CFL numbers of \~{}0.7, with some two-dimensional simulations capable of reaching higher CFL numbers. For three dimensional problems, CFL numbers as high as \~{}0.6 were found to be stable. We show that on resolution-starved meshes, the scheme presented here outperforms unsplit second order Godunov schemes that are based on conventional one-dimensional Riemann solver technology. Strong discontinuities are shown to propagate very isotropically using the methods presented here. The present Riemann solver provides an elegant resolution to the problem of obtaining multi-dimensionally upwinded electric fields in MHD without resorting to a doubling of the dissipation in each dimension. ?? 2012.},

The continuous sensitivity equations are modified to account for the possible presence of shocks in the solution, that result in Dirac source terms for the sensitivity across flow discontinuities. Higher-order accuracy is achieved via a MUSCL reconstruction technique with slope limiting, which makes the numerical solution Total Variation Diminishing (TVD). The Harten-Lax-Van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver is modified so as to account for the influence of source terms in both the flow and sensitivity solutions. Several options are tested for the wave speed estimates and the order of the MUSCL time stepping, such as the MUSCL-Hancock, MUSCL-EVR and MUSCL-HLLG techniques. Convergence analyses on continuous and discontinuous flow problems with analytical solutions indicate that first-order time stepping is approximately twice as fast as second-order time stepping and that it yields more accurate sensitivity solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The shallow water equations (SWEs) are solved numerically in general curvilinear coordinates for predicting flood flows. Second-order accuracy is achieved both in time and space through the use of the MacCormack scheme, in conjunction with a total variation diminishing (TVD) modification. The method is highly efficient as no local characteristic transformation is needed. The possible numerical imbalance induced by the inconsistent evaluation of the flux gradient and source terms is removed by employing the non-conservative form of the SWEs. All of the flow regimes and their transitions can be modelled. Specific considerations have been given to simulating flows in practical environments. The friction-slope term is discretized semi-implicitly when the water depth is smaller than a prescribed value. The check for flooding/drying (wet/dry status of the cell) is performed at each time step. Validation tests include steady flows along a deflected wall and a converging channel, unsteady wave diffraction around a circular cylinder, and the Malpasset dam-break flood in 1959. The results indicate that the present model is able to predict accurately the shock fronts, even over initially dry beds with friction and abrupt slope changes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An upwind, finite volume method is proposed for the direct solution of one-dimensional, hyperbolic systems-based sensitivity equations. Sensitivity equations for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws require a specific treatment of discontinuities, across which Dirac source terms appear, thus leading to modify the classical jump relationships. The modified jump relationships are used to derive an extension of the HLL and HLLC Riemann solvers for the solution of one-dimensional, hyperbolic systems-based sensitivity equations. The solver is developed for 3 ?? 3 systems where the central wave is a contact wave. A specific treatment is needed to preserve the invariance property of the third component of the sensitivity vector along the contact wave. The proposed solver is applied to the one-dimensional, Saint Venant equations with passive, scalar advection and tested successfully against analytical solutions including the influence of topography-induced source terms in both the flow and sensitivity equations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A high-resolution, unstructured grid, finite-volume algorithm is developed for unsteady, two-dimensional, shallow-water flow and scalar transport over arbitrary topography with wetting and drying. The algorithm uses a grid of triangular cells to facilitate grid generation and localized refinement when modeling natural waterways. The algorithm uses Roe’s approximate Riemann solver to compute fluxes, a multidimensional limiter for second-order spatial accuracy, and predictor–corrector time stepping for second-order temporal accuracy. The novel aspect of the algorithm is a robust and efficient procedure to consistently track fluid volume and the free surface elevation in partially submerged cells. This leads to perfect conservation of both fluid and dissolved mass, preservation of stationarity, and near elimination of artificial concentration and dilution of scalars at stationary or moving wet/dry interfaces. Multi-dimensional slope limiters, variable reconstruction, and flux evaluation schemes are optimized in the algorithm on the basis of accuracy per computational effort. DOI:},
